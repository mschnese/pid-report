# pid-report

## Objective: Create a PID controller for an actuator system. This was a group project for my Controls class. The Project involved creating a state space model, creating a PID controller for that state space based on 4 critera, and then writing the report. My contribution was Creating the PID controller through SIMULINK and writing about the controller in the results section of the report.

## Contents:
MATLAB code to graph outputs, Simulink Model for PID system, and the final report written by the group
